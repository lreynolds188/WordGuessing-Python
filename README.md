# WordGuessingGame

In this part of the assignment, you will build a program that bends the rules to trounce its human opponent time and time again. In case you aren't familiar with the Word Guessing game, the rules are as follows:
1. One player chooses a secret word, then writes out a number of dashes equal to the word length.
2. The other player begins guessing letters. Whenever they guess a letter contained in the hidden word, the first player reveals each instance of that letter in the word. Otherwise, the guess is wrong.
3. The game ends either when all the letters in the word have been revealed or when the guesser has run out of guesses.
